#### Tasks/Activities:

**Activity 1: Template Literals**
1. Create a string using template literals that includes variables for a person's name and age, then log the string to the console.
2. Use template literals to create a multi-line string and log it to the console.

**Activity 2: Destructuring**
3. Use array destructuring to extract the first and second elements from an array of numbers, then log them to the console.
4. Use object destructuring to extract the title and author from a book object, then log them to the console.

**Activity 3: Spread and Rest Operators**
5. Use the spread operator to create a new array that includes all elements of an existing array plus additional elements, then log the new array to the console.
6. Use the rest operator in a function to accept an arbitrary number of arguments, sum them, and return the result.

**Activity 4: Default Parameters**
7. Write a function that takes two parameters and returns their product, with the second parameter having a default value of 1. Log the result of calling this function with and without the second parameter.

**Activity 5: Enhanced Object Literals**
8. Use enhanced object literals to create an object with methods and properties, then log the object to the console.
9. Create an object with computed property names based on variables and log the object to the console.

### Feature Requests:

1. **Template Literals Script**: Write a script that demonstrates the use of template literals to create and log strings with embedded variables and multi-line strings.
2. **Destructuring Script**: Create a script that uses array and object destructuring to extract values and log them.
3. **Spread and Rest Operators Script**: Write a script that demonstrates the use of the spread operator to combine arrays and the rest operator to handle multiple function arguments.
4. **Default Parameters Script**: Create a script that defines a function with default parameters and logs the results of calling it with different arguments.
5. **Enhanced Object Literals Script**: Write a script that uses enhanced object literals to create and log an object with methods and computed property names.
