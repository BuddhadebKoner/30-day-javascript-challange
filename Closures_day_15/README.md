#### Activity 1: Understanding Closures
1. **Task 1:** Write a function that returns another function. The inner function should access a variable from the outer function's scope. Call the inner function and log the result.
2. **Task 2:** Create a closure that maintains a private counter. Implement functions to increment and retrieve the current value of the counter.

#### Activity 2: Practical Closures
3. **Task 3:** Write a function that generates unique IDs. Use a closure to keep track of the last generated ID and ensure it increments with each call.
4. **Task 4:** Create a closure that captures a user's name and returns a function that greets the user by name.

#### Activity 3: Closures in Loops
5. **Task 5:** Write a loop that creates an array of functions. Each function should log its index when called. Use a closure to ensure each function logs the correct index.

#### Activity 4: Module Pattern
6. **Task 6:** Use closures to create a simple module for managing a collection of items. Implement methods to add, remove, and list items.

#### Activity 5: Memoization
7. **Task 7:** Write a function that memoizes the results of another function. Use a closure to store the results of previous computations.
8. **Task 8:** Create a memoized version of a function that calculates the factorial of a number.
