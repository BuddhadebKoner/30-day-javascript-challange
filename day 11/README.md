**Activity 1: Understanding Promises**

1. **Task 1:** Create a promise that resolves with a message after a 2-second timeout. Log the resolved message to the console.
2. **Task 2:** Create a promise that rejects with an error message after a 2-second timeout. Handle the rejection using `.catch()` and log the error message.

**Activity 2: Chaining Promises**

3. **Task 3:** Create a sequence of promises that simulate fetching data from a server. Chain the promises to log messages in a specific order.

**Activity 3: Using Async/Await**

4. **Task 4:** Write an `async` function that waits for a promise to resolve and then logs the resolved value.
5. **Task 5:** Write an `async` function that handles a rejected promise using `try-catch` and logs the error message.

**Activity 4: Fetching Data from an API**

6. **Task 6:** Use the `fetch` API to retrieve data from a public API and log the response data to the console using promises.
7. **Task 7:** Use the `fetch` API to retrieve data from a public API and log the response data to the console using `async/await`.

**Activity 5: Concurrent Promises**

8. **Task 8:** Use `Promise.all` to wait for multiple promises to resolve and then log all their resolved values.
9. **Task 9:** Use `Promise.race` to log the value of the first promise that resolves among multiple promises.
