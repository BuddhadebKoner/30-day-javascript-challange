### Tasks/Activities:

#### Activity 1: Object Creation and Access
1. **Task 1:** Create an object representing a book with properties like `title`, `author`, and `year`, then log the object to the console.
2. **Task 2:** Access and log the `title` and `author` properties of the book object.

#### Activity 2: Object Methods
3. **Task 3:** Add a method to the book object that returns a string with the book's title and author, then log the result of calling this method.
4. **Task 4:** Add a method to the book object that takes a parameter (year) and updates the book's `year` property, then log the updated object.

#### Activity 3: Nested Objects
5. **Task 5:** Create a nested object representing a library with properties like `name` and `books` (an array of book objects), then log the library object to the console.
6. **Task 6:** Access and log the `name` of the library and the titles of all the books in the library.

#### Activity 4: The `this` Keyword
7. **Task 7:** Add a method to the book object that uses the `this` keyword to return a string with the book's title and year, then log the result of calling this method.

#### Activity 5: Object Iteration
8. **Task 8:** Use a `for...in` loop to iterate over the properties of the book object and log each property and its value.
9. **Task 9:** Use `Object.keys` and `Object.values` methods to log all the keys and values of the book object.

### Feature Requests:

1. **Book Object Script:** Write a script that creates a book object, adds methods to it, and logs its properties and method results.
2. **Library Object Script:** Create a script that defines a library object containing an array of book objects and logs the library's details.
3. **Object Iteration Script:** Write a script that demonstrates iterating over an object's properties using a `for...in` loop and `Object.keys`/`Object.values`.
